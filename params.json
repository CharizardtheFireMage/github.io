  "body": "### Rules applied towards being voiced in Official Rooms\r\n \r\n1. Do not be rude to other users. Just because you are in power doesn't mean that you can treat others differently then when you were a regular user.\r\n2. Do not ask for rank IN ANY WAY, or else it will take a long time for you to get the rank. Yes we know when you are trying to \"suck up\" to staff, especially the senior staff of the room. We take note of it amongst ourselves. Bottom line: Don't suggest anything about having more power.\r\n3. Don't start a tour that isn't related to the official room itself. NOTE: This does NOT mean you shouldn't start a tour after no one has been voting. Just don't start a tour that shouldn't be played in this room such as OU..\r\n4. We know you are just voices, but try to help all users with any questions they have. If you do not know the answer, it's not the end of the world. Just redirect them to a staff member (preferably the higher the better), who does not have an /away next to their name.\r\n5. Please remember the tour clause, which states you may play every tier twice and then it is void, except for 1v1 and C&E. 1v1 and C&E can be played once, then it is void for the next 2 tours. If you have questions, ask a staff about it and they will assist you. Use /poll void tier,tier as well.\r\n \r\nRemember: Voice takes time to earn, but it is rather easy to lose. We've newly updated the guidelines, and I can say that I've demoted around 10 inactive voices in the past week.\r\n \r\n### How to run tournaments?\r\n \r\nSo you are thinking, \" Hmm, how to start a tournament and begin it at the right time, so then I can be able to do /tour remind and /tour autodq 1.5?\"\r\n \r\nHere is the answer to your question:\r\n \r\nDo !pr and see if there are more than 3 votes in the poll (/votes), then end the poll using /endpoll. [[MAKE SURE YOU START A NEW POLL WITH /RPOLL!!]] After that, begin the tournament by doing /etour tier that was most voted. Once at least 4+ people join the tour in Other Metas (Use your judgement based on how many people are in the room, whether it is a popular tier or not, what time it is, etc.), do /tour autostart 2 or /tour begin,(your judgement again.) Once the tour begins, do /tour remind and /tour autodq 1.5 (there are some occasions such as an event at which you have to rather do /tour autodq 5 to give people time to get prepared during the event).\r\n \r\n \r\nThird, how to bring up the poll during the tournament. !pr is the command to bring up a poll.\r\n \r\n### When should you bring up the poll?\r\n \r\nOnce the tournament has begun and /tour remind and /tour autodq is put in place, that is the right time to do !pr. Also, once the tournament ends with a winner, that is also a good time to bring up the poll using !pr. Once there are 3+ votes, end the poll immediately and begin the voted tour.\r\nNote: It is OK to end at 2 votes depending on the case. Again, this is a judgmental thing.\r\n \r\nWAIT, WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS A TIE IN THE POLL!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!??!?!?!?\r\n \r\nIf there is a tie in the poll for example:\r\n \r\nResults to \"Next type of Tour?\"\r\n \r\nPoll ended by Trainer Alain\r\n• cap - 33% (1)\r\n• battle factory - 33% (1)\r\n• inverse battle - 33% (1)\r\n \r\n \r\nJust do !dice ( number of tiers that tied) and if one number is chosen, begin that tour.\r\n \r\nAt this case, CAP is #1, Battle Factory is #2, and Inverse Battle is #3.\r\n \r\nSo do !dice 3.\r\n \r\nYou get a random dice, which in turn leads to 2. So begin the Battle Factory tournament using /etour Battle Factory.\r\n \r\n### VERY ESPECIALLY EXTREMELY INSANELY IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS YOU NEED TO KEEP:\r\nOther Metas Staff Leave Form.
